# Exploring Routing Strategies in Micro Frontends with Webpack Module Federation

Micro Frontends, coupled with Webpack Module Federation, have revolutionized the way we build and scale applications. One critical aspect is routing between the host application and its micro frontends (MFEs). In this blog post, we'll delve into various approaches for achieving seamless routing in a micro frontend architecture using Webpack Module Federation.

## Background

Webpack Module Federation facilitates the composition of independent, self-contained modules into a unified application. Each module, in this context, represents a micro frontend. When it comes to navigation between these micro frontends and the host, there are multiple strategies to consider.

## 1. **Centralized Routing Configuration**

In this approach, the host application manages the routing configuration centrally. The host defines all routes and loads the appropriate micro frontend based on the route requested. This central control ensures a consistent user experience and allows the host to dictate the overall application structure.

Pros:
- Unified routing control in the host.
- Easier to implement shared layouts and navigation elements.

Cons:
- Potential bottleneck as the host handles all routing logic.
- Less independence for micro frontends.

## 2. **Decentralized Routing**

Alternatively, micro frontends can maintain their individual routing configurations. Each MFE defines its routes and renders them independently. The host dynamically fetches and embeds the required micro frontend based on the requested route. This approach promotes independence among micro frontends.

Pros:
- Micro frontends manage their own routes.
- Enhanced independence and isolation.

Cons:
- Potential for inconsistent user experience if not coordinated well.
- Extra care needed to handle shared navigation elements.

## 3. **Hybrid Approach**

Combining elements of centralized and decentralized routing, the hybrid approach allows both the host and micro frontends to contribute to the routing structure. The host retains control over core routes, while micro frontends can define additional routes specific to their functionality.

Pros:
- A balance between central control and micro frontend independence.
- Flexibility for micro frontends to extend routes.

Cons:
- Complexity in coordinating routes between the host and micro frontends.
- Care needed to prevent clashes in route definitions.

## 4. **Event-Driven Routing**

This approach leverages a pub-sub or event-driven mechanism to communicate routing changes between the host and micro frontends. When a route changes, an event is emitted, triggering the appropriate micro frontend to handle the route change independently.

Pros:
- Loose coupling between host and micro frontends.
- Promotes independence and decoupling.

Cons:
- Potential for increased complexity in handling events.
- Care needed to maintain a consistent user experience.

## Conclusion

Routing in a micro frontend architecture with Webpack Module Federation involves a careful consideration of trade-offs between central control and micro frontend independence. The chosen strategy depends on factors such as project requirements, team collaboration, and the desired level of autonomy for micro frontends.

Ultimately, the flexibility offered by Webpack Module Federation empowers developers to choose the routing approach that best aligns with their application's architecture and goals. Whether opting for a centralized, decentralized, hybrid, or event-driven strategy, the key is to strike a balance that fosters maintainability, scalability, and a seamless user experience.
