21. **Scalability Needs:**
    - How do you assess the importance of scalability in the context of hosting our micro-frontends and BFFs?

22. **Flexibility for Change:**
    - How adaptable do you think our chosen micro-frontend, BFF, and hosting strategy should be to accommodate changes and evolving requirements?

23. **SEO Requirements:**
    - Considering our micro-frontend application, are there specific SEO considerations that need attention?

This comprehensive questionnaire aims to guide discussions and decision-making processes for micro-frontends, BFFs, and hosting types, ensuring that key aspects are considered in the development and deployment strategy.



1. **Project Scope:**
   - What is the size and complexity of the project?
   - Are there distinct, independent features that can be developed and deployed separately?

3. **Frontend Independence:**
   - Are there different frontend teams responsible for distinct parts of the application?
   - Do different parts of the UI require different technologies or frameworks?

4. **Technology Stack:**
   - What frontend frameworks and libraries are currently in use?
   - Are there any existing constraints or preferences in the technology stack?

5. **Scalability Requirements:**
   - Is there a need for independently scalable components?
   - What is the expected growth in terms of user base and features?

6. **Deployment and Versioning:**
   - How frequently do you plan to deploy updates to the frontend?
   - How will versioning be managed for micro frontends?

7. **Communication and Integration:**
   - How will communication between micro frontends be handled?
   - What integration patterns will be used to ensure seamless user experience?
